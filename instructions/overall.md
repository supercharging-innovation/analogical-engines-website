# Instructions

We are building this company based out of foundational research on Analogical Innovation here at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. This is still an early-stage company and we are still not launched. So, the website we want to build should signify early-stage, "launching soon" vibes, and seek interest. It should not have a whole lot of meat to reveal. 

I want to make sure it is flashy and modern enough that it should catch the attention of potential investors and partners. 

I am thinking if we can use Scrollytelling as a medium to tell the story of the company. I also want to leverage three.js to create a modern, interactive, 3D experience on the landing page. 

I have added some of the assets in the @assets folder (this has the company logo (tentative), the CMU HCII logo). 

I think what could be cool is if we just showed some kind of explosive 3D interactive animation of the process of analogical innovation.

We could show how: 

1. We start with a really interesting commonly known scenario in nature (e.g., origami, honeycomb, etc.) We need to think of something that is interesting but not too common in the biomimicry space. Coz we are much more universal than just biomimicry but we can still start with something that is interesting. 
2. The animation experience should SHOW how we are deconstructing the scenario to understand the underlying mechanism. 
3. And then after we show some understandng of the mechanism (I am thinking we show it in action, 360% view, etc.), we would then show this can be adapted in a completely different context to solve an important problem in that new space.
4. We map the mechanism to the problem space and show how it can be creatively adapted to solve the problem.
5. We may show multiple variants of the adaptation and then show that we would be constantly testing against real-world constraints to continuously iterate and improve the idea.
6. Finally, we would show some animation of the final dossier (or a cut-out or a scrolled GIF) of the solution concept we finally arrived at. 

Basically this is how we can show the process of analogical innovation and the value of the platform. And somehow in the content, we should show and highlight studies talking about cognitive fixation and how it is a problem in R&D. And how it is pain to figure out which ideas are good and which are not. And we are going to be solving this entire problem i.e., the fuzzy-front end of innovation. 

So, important to highlight this in order: 

- What is the problem
- Why does it matter 
- Why is it a problem 
- How are we solving it 
- Why should you be interested in it 

For the teaser website: 

When you land on the website, maybe the first scene is just the background (some transparency): like a town, mountains, clouds, but somehow dark --> cartoony maybe? night time?

We scrolll down: and we should talk about the actual analogical breakthroughs examples overlayed and show that these were like lightning strikes and that these analogies are powerful BUT rare, unpredictable, and uncontrollable 

We scroll down further to show that we have now captured the lightning AND so we need to figure out what to overlay here. 

And then we scroll down further to show that we have now powered the grid AND so we need to figure out what to overlay here. 

And then wrap it up. 

When I say scroll: it's scrollytelling: the background is changing to tell a story and the overlay or the layout is also showing the actual examples. Maybe the alignment of things, color, layout is such that the lightning scene is probably happening on the left or the right side and the content is overlayed on the other side. And it's not a smooth edge... it's like ink splotch maybe. 

Do you get what I am saying? 

## Thesis for the Company (Background Information)

### Technology Description

Analogical Engines is an AI platform that accelerates innovation by helping R&D teams find novel solution pathways, addressing the growing challenge that ideas are getting harder—and more costly—to uncover. A major driver of diminishing R&D returns is fixation: as experts become increasingly hyper-specialized, they get locked into familiar solution patterns and quickly exhaust the low-hanging fruit in their domain. While today’s “AI co-scientists” excel at optimizing well-defined solution spaces (e.g., protein folding or material discovery), they are not built for open-ended exploration and converge on familiar ideas rather than uncover the cross-domain possibilities where breakthroughs originate.
Analogical Engines addresses this by using structural analogies to surface novel inspirations from diverse domains and helping teams adapt them into concrete, testable concepts. Rooted in over a decade of cognitive science, HCI, and AI research at CMU, the platform goes beyond keyword and similarity search by identifying underlying mechanisms that reveal entirely new directions for solving a problem—turning rare cross-domain leaps like NASA’s origami-inspired solar arrays into a systematic, repeatable part of the innovation process. We don’t just search for better versions of what you have; we surface fundamentally different possibilities and provide early evidence to de-risk and prioritize which ideas to pursue. 
 
### Commercial Application

Analogical Engines serves R&D experts, engineers, designers, and innovation teams in automotive, advanced manufacturing, and materials and packaging—industries that invest heavily in research yet find breakthrough ideas increasingly difficult and costly to generate. These teams will use the platform to explore new technical directions, evaluate emerging technologies, and generate early concept options far faster and more broadly than current methods allow. Today, early-stage exploration depends on expert brainstorming, literature reviews, and searching internal knowledge bases, which often circle back to familiar ideas and can take months before a promising direction emerges. With Analogical Engines, users bring high-level technical challenges into the platform—for example, “How can we create a structure that withstands impact while using less material?”—and the system surfaces concrete ideas from other fields, such as architectural honeycomb patterns, aerospace lattice mechanisms, or deployable origami structures that could be adapted to solve the problem. The platform then delivers a short, ranked list of worked-out “idea sparks” that turn those inspirations into concrete options R&D teams can quickly assess or prototype. This reduces time spent on unproductive exploration, surfaces promising directions much sooner, and helps organizations focus effort on ideas with real breakthrough potential. 
 
### Value Proposition

Analogical Engines helps R&D teams escape the narrow idea spaces they usually revisit and uncover fundamentally new solution directions with real breakthrough potential. We help teams break fixation and explore more creatively, revealing possibilities they would have otherwise overlooked and turning them into concrete, actionable concepts. This reduces wasted early-stage exploration and shortens the time needed to identify viable directions worth developing. Organizations can then shift time and budget from searching for ideas to testing bold, high-potential concepts, increasing the likelihood that at least one becomes a true breakthrough.

Absolutely. Below is a **venture-ready, scrollytelling “Coming Soon” website concept** for **Analogical Engines**—written as *final web copy*, not notes. It’s designed to work as a **single static page** (Webflow-friendly), with strong narrative flow, restrained claims, and visual pacing. Think: **research gravity + startup clarity**.

I’ll structure this in three layers:

1. **Overall scrollytelling arc**
2. **Section-by-section website copy (ready to paste)**
3. **Design & interaction notes (for Webflow implementation)**

## 1. Scrollytelling Arc (the story you’re telling)

**From problem → insight → new capability → future**

1. *The innovation paradox* (why progress feels harder)
2. *The hidden force behind breakthroughs* (analogy)
3. *The problem with analogy today* (serendipity, fixation)
4. *What Analogical Engines makes possible* (systematic, human–AI)
5. *How it works (at a high level)* (SMART, without jargon overload)

7. *Coming soon* (credibility, research roots, invitation)

This is not a product demo page.
It’s a **thesis page**.

**Headline**

### Breakthroughs don’t come from nowhere.

They come from *elsewhere*.

**Subhead**
Analogical Engines is building a cognitive AI platform that helps scientists, engineers, and innovators systematically discover and adapt breakthrough ideas from across domains.

**Status line (small)**
Coming soon.

---

### SECTION 1 — *The Problem*

**Headline**

### We’re investing more in innovation—

and getting less of it.

**Body**
Across science, engineering, and R&D, progress is slowing.
Not because we lack talent, data, or computation—but because discovery itself has become harder.

Experts dig deeper into narrower domains.
Teams exhaust familiar solution spaces.
The next breakthrough is often *somewhere else*—but difficult to see.

**Headline**

### History’s biggest leaps were analogical.

**Body**
The bullet train inspired by a bird’s beak.
Space structures folded like origami.
Medical devices born from a simple mechanical trick.

Breakthroughs often happen when a mechanism from one domain reshapes another.

This is **analogical reasoning**—
one of humanity’s most powerful creative tools.

---

### SECTION 3 — *The Gap*

**Headline**

### But analogy today is fragile.

**Body**
Analogical breakthroughs still depend on chance:

* The right person
* With the right memory
* At the right moment

Humans fixate.
Search tools reward surface similarity.
Generative AI tends to remix what we already know.

What if analogy wasn’t accidental?

**Headline**

### We’re turning serendipity into a system.

**Body**
Analogical Engines is building an end-to-end, human–AI engine that:

* Finds *far-field analogies* across millions of sources
* Extracts the *mechanisms that actually matter*
* Translates them into *actionable, testable ideas*
* Helps experts evaluate, adapt, and de-risk them

Not replacing human judgment—
**amplifying it.**

---

### SECTION 5 — *How It Works (High Level)*

**Headline**

### From inspiration to implementation.

**Body (structured, minimal jargon)**

Our platform supports the full arc of analogical innovation:

* **Search** — Discover structurally similar solutions from distant domains
* **Map** — Identify which mechanisms transfer—and which don’t
* **Adapt** — Generate concrete concept variants grounded in constraints
* **Refine** — Explore trade-offs, alternatives, and risks
* **Test** — Surface evidence paths for feasibility and impact

This is not idea generation.
It’s **breakthrough acceleration**.
